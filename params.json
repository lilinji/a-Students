As I grew older and wiser I discovered the world would not change, so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. Bu it too seemed immovable. As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those closest to me. But alas they would have none of it. And now as I lie on my deathbed I suddenly realized: If I had only changed myself first, then by example I would have changed my family. From their inspiration and encouragement I would have been able to better my country and, who knows, maybe even change the world.\r\n\r\n当我还年轻，我的想象力没有任何限制，我梦想改变这个世界。但当我年事渐长，阅历增多，我发现我不能改变世界，所以我缩短了我的目光有些决定只改变我的国家。但这个目标还是太大了。当我进入暮年以后，做最后一次绝望的尝试，我决定只改变我的家人，给我最亲密的人。但很可惜，这似乎也不可能. 现在，当我现在躺在床上，行将就木时，我突然意识到：如果一开始我仅仅去改变我自己，然后，我可能改变我的家庭；在家人的帮助和鼓励下，我可能为国家做一些事情；然后，谁知道呢？我甚至可能改变这个世界。","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
